=head1 Issues fixed after release 20201001

=item b<fix parsing problem with $#>

A problem with parsing variables of the form $# and $#array was found in
testing and fixed.  For most variables the leading sigil may be separated from
the remaining part of the identifier by whitespace.  An exception is for a
variable beginning with '$#'.  If there is any space between the '$' and '#'
then the '#' starts a comment.  So the following snippet is has valid syntax
and is equivalent to $ans=40;

    my $ #
    #
    ans = 40;

This was being misparsed and was fixed 17 Oct 2020.

=item b<fix missing line break for hash of subs with signatures>

During testing the following error was found and fixed.
Given the following input snippet:

    get(
        on_ready => sub ($worker) {
            $on_ready->end;
            return;
        },
        on_exit => sub ( $worker, $status ) { return; },
    );

The resulting formatting was

    get(
        on_ready => sub ($worker) {
            $on_ready->end;
            return;
        }, on_exit => sub ( $worker, $status ) { return; },
    );

Notice that the break after the comma has been lost.  The problem was traced to
a short-cut taken by the code looking for one-line blocks. The unique
circumstances in which this occured involved a hash of anonymous subs, one with
a signature with multiple parameters and short enough to be a one-line block,
as in the last sub definition line.  This was fixed 17 Oct 2020.

=item b<fix issues with prototype and signature parsing>

Problems with parsing prototypes and signatures were found during testing and
fixed 17 Oct 2020 in 'fixed problem parsing multi-line signatures with
comments', 017fd07.  For example the following snippet was mis-parsed because
of the hash mark. 

    sub test ( # comment ))) 
        $x, $x) { $x+$y }


Complex signature expressions such as the following are now parsed without
error:

    sub t086
        ( #foo)))
        $ #foo)))
        a #foo)))
        ) #foo)))
        { $a.$b }

The parenthesized expression in the snippet below was parsed as a prototype
rather than a signature.  This was fixed.

    sub echo ( $message = 'Hello World!' ) {
        print "$message\n";
    }

=item b<improve guess for pattern or division>

The following line caused a tokenization error in which the two slashes
were parsed as a pattern.  

   my $masksize = ceil( Opcode::opcodes / 8 );    # /

This problem was discovered in random testing.  When a slash follows a bareword
whose prototype is not known to perltidy, it has to guess whether the slash
starts a pattern or is a division.  The guessing logic was rewritten and 
improved 14 Oct 2020 in 'rewrote logic to guess if divide or pattern', afebe2f.

=item b<fix -bos to keep isolated semicolon breaks after block braces>

The flag B<-bos>,  or B<--break-at-old-semicolon-breakpoints>, keeps breaks
at old isolated semicolons. For example

    $z = sqrt($x**2 + $y**2)
      ;

In testing it was found not to be doing this after braces which require
semicolons, such as 'do' and anonymous subs. This was fixed 12 Oct 2020 in
'fix -bos to work with semicolons after braces', 03ee7fc.  For example

    my $dist = sub {
        $z = sqrt( $x**2 + $y**2 )
          ;
      }
      ;

=item b<keep break after 'use overload'>

If a line break occurs after B<use overload> then it will now be kept. Previously
it was dropped.  For example, this would be kept intact:

                use overload
                    '+' => sub {
                        print length $_[2], "\n";
                        my ( $x, $y ) = _order(@_);
                        Number::Roman->new( int $x + $y );
                    },
                    '-' => sub {
                        my ( $x, $y ) = _order(@_);
                        Number::Roman->new( int $x - $y );
                    },
                    ...

This keeps the list from shifting to the right and can avoid problems in
formatting the list with certain styles, including with the -xci flag.
Fixed 12 Oct 2020 in 'keep break after use overload statement', 8485afa.

=item B<added flag -xci to improve formatting when -ci and -i are equal, issue git #28>

This flag causes continuation indentation to "extend" deeper into structures.
If you use B<-ci=n> and B<-i=n> with the same value of B<n> you will probably
want to set this flag.  Since this is a fairly new flag, the default is B<-nxci> 
to avoid disturbing existing formatting.  

=item B<terminal braces not indenting correctly with -bli formatting, issue git #40>

This problem is illustrated with the following snippet when run with -bli -blil='*'
 
    #-bli -bli list='*'
    try
      {
        die;
      }
    catch
      {
        die;
      };    # <-- this was not indenting

This was due to conflicting rules and was fixed 1 Oct 2020 in commit
'fix issue git #40, incorrect closing brace indentation with -bli', a5aefe9.

At the same time, it was noted that block types sort/map/grep and eval were not
following -bli formatting when -blil='*' and this was fixed.  For example, with
corrected formatting, we would have

  # perltidy -bli -blil='*'
    eval
      {
        my $app = App::perlbrew->new( "install-patchperl", "-q" );
        $app->run();
      }
      or do
      {
        $error          = $@;
        $produced_error = 1;
      };

=head1 Issues fixed after release 20200907

This is a detailed log of changes since the release 20200907. All bugs were
found with the help of automated random testing.

=over


=item B<Keep any space between a bareword and quote>

In random testing, the -mangle option introduced a syntax error by deleting
the space between barewords and quotes (test file 'MxScreen'), such as:

  oops"Your login, $Bad_Login, is not valid";

Sub 'is_essential_whitespace' was updated to prevent this on 27 Sep 2020, 
in 'keep any space between a bareword and quote', f32553c.

=item B<Fixed some incorrect indentation disagreements reported in LOG file> 

The .LOG file reports any disagreements between the indentation of the input and output files.
This can help locate brace errors.  These were incorrect when some of the
options were used, including --whitespace-cycle, -bbhb, -nib.  This was
corrected 24 Sep 2020, 'fixed incorrect log entry for indentation
disagreement', 3d40545. At the same time, locations of closing brace
indentation disagreements are now tracked and reported in the .ERR file when
there is a brace error.  This can help localize the error if the file was
previously formatted by perltidy.

=item B<If an =cut starts a POD section within code, give a warning>

Previously only a complaint was given, which went into the log file and was not normally
seen.  Perl silently accepts this but it can cause significant problems with pod utilities, so
a clear warning is better.  This situation arose in testing on random files in combination with
a -dp flag and it took some time to understand the results because of the lack of a warning.

=item B<Switched from using an eval block to the ->can() function for sub finish_formatting>

This is not a bug, but is cleaner coding and insures that error messages get reported.
This change was made 20 Sep 2020, 'switch from eval { } to ->can('finish_formatting')', 28f2a4f.


=item B<fixed uninitialized value reference>

The following message was generated during automated testing

 Use of uninitialized value $cti in numeric eq (==) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 12079.
 Use of uninitialized value $cti in numeric eq (==) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 12089.
 Use of uninitialized value $cti in numeric eq (==) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 12097.

The problem could be simplified to running perltidy -wn on this snippet:

     __PACKAGE__->load_components( qw(
>         Core
> 
>     ) );

This was fixed 20 Sep 2020 in 'fixed_uninitialized_value', 8d6c4ed.

=item B<fix incorrect parsing of certain deprecated empty here-docs >

The following snippet was being incorrecly parsed:

 print <<
 # Hello World 13!
 
   ;
 print "DONE\n";

This is a deprecated here-doc without a specified target but currently still a
valid program.  It would have been correctly parsed if the semicolon followed 
the '<<' operator rather than the here-doc.  

This was found in random testing and fixed 16 Sep 2020.  A warning message about
deprecated here-doc targets was added.

=item B<make the arrow a vertical alignment token, git #39>

The -> can now be vertically aligned if a space is placed before it with -wls='->'.
Added 15 Sep 2020 as part of previous item, 9ac6af6.

=item B<add flags -bbhb=n, -bbsb=n, =bbp=n, git #38>

These flags give control over the opening token of a multiple-line list. They are
described in the man pages, perltidy.html.
Added 15 Sep 2020 in "added flags -bbhb=n, -bbsb=n, -bbq=n, suggestion git #38".
9ac6af6.

=item B<Allow vertical alignment of line-ending fat comma>

A change was made to allow a '=>' at the end of a line to align vertically, 
provided that it aligns with two or more other '=>' tokens.
This update was 14 Sep 2020, 'Allow line-ending '=>' to align vertically', ea96739.

=item B<fixed uninitialized value reference>

The following message was generated when running perltidy on random text:

 Use of uninitialized value $K_semicolon in subtraction (-) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 16467.

This was fixed 14 Sep 2020, included in 'Allow line-ending '=>' to align vertically', ea96739.

=item B<Do not create a zero size file by deleting semicolons>

A rule was added to prevent a file consisting of a single semicolon
  
 ;

from becoming a zero length file.  This could cause problems with other
software. Fixed 13 Sep 2020, 'do not create a zero length file by deleting semicolons', b39195e.

=item B<fixed uninitialized value reference>

The following message was generated when running perltidy on random text:

 Use of uninitialized value $cti in numeric eq (==) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 11926.
 Use of uninitialized value $cti in numeric eq (==) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 11936.
 Use of uninitialized value $cti in numeric eq (==) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 11944.

This was fixed 13 Sep 2020 in 'fixed unitialized variable problem ', adb2096.

=item B<fixed uninitialized value reference>

The following message was generated when running perltidy on random text:

 substr outside of string at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Tokenizer.pm line 7362.
 Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Tokenizer.pm line 7362.

This was fixed 13 Sep 2020 in 'fixed unitialized variable problem', 5bf49a3.

=item B<fixed uninitialized value reference>

The following message was generated when running perltidy on random text:

 Use of uninitialized value $K_opening in subtraction (-) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 16467.

This was fixed 13 Sep 2020 in 'fix undefined variable reference', 1919482.

=item B<hashbang warning changed>

The following snippet generated a warning that there might be a hash-bang
after the start of the script.  

 $x = 2;
 #!  sunos does not yet provide a /usr/bin/perl
 $script = "$^X $script";

To prevent this annoyance, the warning is not given unless the first nonblank
character after the '#!' is a '/'.  Note that this change is just for the
warning message. The actual hash bang check does not require the slash.

Fixed 13 Sep 2020, 'prevent unnecessary hash-bang warning message' 4f7733e
and 'improved hash-bang warning filter', fa84904.

=item B<uninitialized index referenced>

An unitialized index was referenced when running on a file of randomly generated text:

  Use of uninitialized value $K_oo in subtraction (-) at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 7259.

This was fixed 12 Sep 2020 in 'fixed undefined index', 616bb88.

=item B<Oops message triggered>

The parameter combination -lp -wc triggered an internal bug message from perltidy:

 398: Program bug with -lp.  seqno=77 should be 254 and i=1 should be less than max=-1
 713: The logfile perltidy.LOG may contain useful information
 713: 
 713: Oops, you seem to have encountered a bug in perltidy.  Please check the
 713: BUGS file at http://perltidy.sourceforge.net.  If the problem is not
 713: listed there, please report it so that it can be corrected.  Include the
 ...

The problem is that the parameters --line-up-parentheses and
--whitespace-cycle=n are not compatible.  The fix is to write a message and
turn off the -wc parameter when the both occur.  This was fixed 8 Sep 2020 in
"do not allow -wc and -lp together, can cause bugs", 7103781.

=item B<Internal fault detected by perltidy>

This snippet after processing with the indicated parameters triggered a Fault
message in store-token-to-go due to discontinuous internal index values :

  perltidy --noadd-newlines --space-terminal-semicolon

  if ( $_ =~ /PENCIL/ ) { $pencil_flag= 1 } ; ;
  $yy=1;

This triggered the message:

 ==============================================================================
 While operating on input stream with name: '<stdin>'
 A fault was detected at line 7472 of sub 'Perl::Tidy::Formatter::store_token_to_go'
 in file '/home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm'
 which was called from line 8298 of sub 'Perl::Tidy::Formatter::process_line_of_CODE'
 Message: 'Unexpected break in K values: 591 != 589+1'
 This is probably an error introduced by a recent programming change. 
 ==============================================================================

The deletion of the extra, spaced, comma had created an extra space in the token array which
had not been forseen in the original programming. It was fixed 10 Sep 2020 in
"fixed very rare fault found with automated testing", eb1b1d9.

=item B<Error parsing deprecated $# variable>

This problem can be illustrated with this two-line snippet:

  $#
  eq$,?print"yes\n":print"no\n";

Perltidy joined '$#' and 'eq' to get $#eq, but should have stopped at the line end to
get $# followed by keyword 'eq'.  (Note that $# is deprecated). This was fixed 11 Sep 2020 in
"fixed several fringe parsing bugs found in testing", 85e01b7.

=item B<Error message parsing a file with angle brackets and ternaries>

This problem can be illustrated with the following test snippet which was not correctly parsed. 

 print$$ <300?"$$<300\n":$$<700?"$$<700\n":$$<2_000?"$$<2,000\n":$$<10_000?"$$ <10,000\n":"$$>9,999\n";

The problem is related to the '<' symbol following the '$$' variable, a possible filehandle,
and is similar to a previous bug. The problem was corrected 11 Sep 2020 in
"fixed several fringe parsing bugs found in testing", 85e01b7.  The line now correctly
formats to

 print $$ < 300  ? "$$<300\n"
   : $$ < 700    ? "$$<700\n"
   : $$ < 2_000  ? "$$<2,000\n"
   : $$ < 10_000 ? "$$ <10,000\n"
   :               "$$>9,999\n";


=item B<code crash with cuddled-else formatting on unbalanced files>

A file with incorrect bracing which effectively gave negative indentation
caused a crash when a stack was referenced with a negative index. The problem
was fixed 8 Sept 2020 in 
"convert array to hash to avoid trouble with neg levels in bad files", a720e0d.

=item B<error message 'Unterminated angle operator?'>

This error can be demonstrated with this line.

  print $i <10 ? "yes" : "no";

Perl has some strange parsing rules near a possible filehandle, and they change
over time. The '<' here is a less than symbol, but perltidy expected that it
might be the start of an angle operator, based on the old rules, and gave a
warning. The formatting was still correct, but the warning was confusing.  This
has been fixed 8 Sep 2020 in 'remove confusing warning message', 0a4d725.


=item B<Line broken after here target>

This problem is illustrated with the following snippet

  $sth= $dbh->prepare (<<"END_OF_SELECT") or die "Couldn't prepare SQL" ;
      SELECT COUNT(duration),SUM(duration) 
      FROM logins WHERE username='$user'
  END_OF_SELECT

When run with a short line length it got broken after the here target,
causing an error.  This was due to a recent program change and fixed
7 Sep 2020 in 'fixed bug where long line with here target got broken', 8f7e4cb.


=item B<undefined variable named 'test2'>

An uninitialized value was being referenced and triggered this message:

 undefined test2, i_opening=5, max=18, caller=Perl::Tidy::Formatter ./perltidy-20200907.pl 13465
 Use of uninitialized value $test2 in numeric eq (==) at ./perltidy-20200907.pl line 19692.

Fixed 8 Sep 2020 in 'fixed rare problem with stored index values for -lp option', 4147c8c.

=item B<Line order switched at start of quoted text>

This problem arose in several scripts involving the parameter
--line-up-parentheses pluse one or more of the vertical tightness flags.
It can be illustrated with the following snippet:

    perltidy --line-up-parentheses --paren-vertical-tightness=1

    if (
        ( $name, $chap ) =
        $cur_fname =~ m!^Bible/
	  .*?/		# testament
	  .*?/		# range of books
	  (.*?)/	# book name
	  .*?		# optional range of verses
	  (\d+)$!x
      )
    {
        $cur_name = "$name $chap";
    }

This gave 

    if (( $name, $chap ) =
	  .*?/		# testament
        $cur_fname =~ m!^Bible/
	  .*?/		# range of books
	  (.*?)/	# book name
	  .*?		# optional range of verses
	  (\d+)$!x
      )
    {
        $cur_name = "$name $chap";
    }

Notice the incorrect line order.  The problem was an incorrect order of
operations in the vertical aligner flush, leaving a line stranded and coming
out in the wrong order.  This was fixed 11 Sep 2020.

=item B<crash due to bad index named '$j_terminal_match'>

This crash was due to an index error which caused a non-existant object to be
referenced. The problem is fixed 2020-09-07 in "fix problem of undefined values involving j_terminal_match",
c5bfa77.  The particular parameters which caused this were:

    --noadd-newlines --nowant-left-space='=' 

=item B<an issue with the -x flag>

This is not a bug but did take some time to resolve.  The problem was reduced to the
following script run with the -x flag (--look-for-hash-bang)

 print(SCRIPT$headmaybe . <<EOB . <<'EOF' .$tailmaybe),$!;
 #!$wd/perl
 EOB
 print "\$^X is $^X, \$0 is $0\n";
 EOF

The resulting file had a syntax error (here-doc target EOB changed).

 print(SCRIPT$headmaybe . <<EOB . <<'EOF' .$tailmaybe),$!;
 #!$wd/perl
 EOB print "\$^X is $^X, \$0 is $0\n";
 EOF

The problem is that the -x flag tells perltidy not to start parsing until it sees a
line starting with '#!', which happens to be in a here-doc in this case.

A warning was added to the manual 7 Sept 2020 in "add warning about
inappropriate -x flag", fe66743.

=item B<error parsing sub signature>

This problem was reduced to the following snippet:

 substr
 (
  $#
 )

The deprecated variable '$#' was being parsed incorrectly, and this was due to an error
in which the word 'substr' followed by a paren was taken as the start of a sub signature.
The problem was fixed 8 Sep 2020 in 'fix problem parsing sub prototypes' 569e05f.
The code 

  $container_type =~ /^sub/;

was corrected to be

  $container_type =~ /^sub\b/;


=item B<uninitialized value message, found 7 Sep 2020>

Unitialized values were referenced.  An index was not being tested.
Fixed 8 Sep 2020 in "fix undefined variable", 9729965.

 Use of uninitialized value $Kon in array element at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 4022.
 Use of uninitialized value $Kon in array element at /home/steve/bin/Perl/Tidy/Formatter.pm line 4023.
