# immediate initialization of locals is not appropriate where used
# in the Tokenizer.pm module
[-Variables::RequireInitializationForLocalVars] 

# C-style for loops are essential when working with multiple indexed
# arrays
[-ControlStructures::ProhibitCStyleForLoops] 

# There is a stringy eval in Formatter.pm which is essential.  
[-BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitStringyEval] 

# maintaining VERSION numbers for all internal modules introduces
# needless maintenance issues
[-Modules::RequireVersionVar]

[-Modules::ProhibitAutomaticExportation]

# print and close homonyms are appropriate where they are used.
[-Subroutines::ProhibitBuiltinHomonyms]

# Nested subs are needed for error handling in Tidy.pm. 
[-Subroutines::ProhibitNestedSubs]

# constants are needed for clean array indexing.

# effect.
