# Following is a list of policies to be skipped:  

# There is a localization in Tokenizer.pm that is essential
[-Variables::ProhibitLocalVars] 

# immediate initialization of locals is not appropriate where used
# in the Tokenizer.pm module
[-Variables::RequireInitializationForLocalVars] 

# C-style for loops are avoided now because profiling shows them to be very slow
# [-ControlStructures::ProhibitCStyleForLoops]

# There is a stringy eval in Formatter.pm which is essential.  
[-BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitStringyEval] 

# Tidy.pm exports 'perltidy'. Changing this could break existing scripts.
[-Modules::ProhibitAutomaticExportation]

# print and close homonyms are appropriate where they are used.
[-Subroutines::ProhibitBuiltinHomonyms]

# Nested subs are needed for error handling in Tidy.pm. 
[-Subroutines::ProhibitNestedSubs]

# In critical routines this can significantly reduce processing speed
[-Subroutines::RequireArgUnpacking]

# constants are needed for clean array indexing.
[-ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitConstantPragma]

# Adding quotes on here doc terminators causes needless "line noise" in the
# source code.  My editor uses color to make it clear if interpolation is in
# effect.
[-ValuesAndExpressions::RequireQuotedHeredocTerminator]

# Perlcritic doesn't know ARGV actually is localized
[-Variables::RequireLocalizedPunctuationVars]
